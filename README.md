Character data editor for [Toshe's Quest II](https://github.com/1bengardner/toshes-quest-ii).

## âš  Warning

Using the editor may render your saved file incompatible with the game. If you manage to mess up your saved game, you'll have to un-mess it yourself. Keep a backup!

## Requirements

The editor depends on many [game source](https://github.com/1bengardner/toshes-quest-ii/tree/master/source) files including its images and data.

- Modules must be in the same directory as `editor.py`
- The `images` directory must be in the same directory as `editor.py` (i.e. `.\images\` must contain the contents of `<game-source>\resources\assets\images\`)
- The `data` directory must be in the same directory as `editor.py` (same as above)

On Windows, you can use the included [mklinks.bat](mklinks.bat) to speed up linking the required files from your game source directory.
